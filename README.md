# Plasma Cash

*Plasma Cash is Plasma*

This is a Vyper implementation of Plasma Cash.
The work is derivative of implementations of Plasma Cash from
[Loom](https://github.com/loomnetwork/plasma-cash),
[OmiseGO](https://github.com/omisego/plasma-cash),
and the Plasma MVP implementation written in Vyper from
[LayerX](https://github.com/LayerXcom/plasma-mvp-vyper).
It only works with ERC721 tokens, and is optimized for that.

It serves as the basis for our [PlasmaRifle](https://github.com/GunClear/PlasmaRifle) bridge,
although significant modifications are made in that project for the sake of supporting zkSNARKs
and GunClear's specific requirements for that project.

Contributions welcome!
