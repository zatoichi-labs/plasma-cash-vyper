### TRANSFER FUNCTIONS ###

# @dev Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current owner, an authorized operator, or the approved
#      address for this NFT. 
#      Throws if `_from` is not the current owner. 
#      Throws if `_to` is the zero address. 
#      Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT.
# @notice The caller is responsible to confirm that `_to` is capable of receiving NFTs or else
#         they maybe be permanently lost.
# @param _from The current owner of the NFT.
# @param _to The new owner.
# @param _tokenId The NFT to transfer.

# @dev Transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address.
# @notice Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current owner, an authorized operator, or the

#         function checks if `_to` is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, it calls `onERC721Received`
#         on `_to` and throws if the return value is not `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,uint256,bytes)"))`.

# @param _from The current owner of the NFT.
# @param _to The new owner.
# @param _tokenId The NFT to transfer.
